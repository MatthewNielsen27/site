                        The Electrical and Computer Engineering society was founded in 2018 to promote a sense of community
                        and unity among ECE students and to host events that better represent their interests. We have hosted
                        various social events such as game nights and pub crawls. In addition, we continually work to create
                        academic resources that aim to serve as knowledge base for future generations of ECE students.
